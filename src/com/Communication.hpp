/**
 * @brief Interface for all interprocess communication classes.
 *
 * By default, communication is done within the local communication space. In
 * order to connect to a different communication space, i.e. coupling
 * participant, the methods acceptConnection() and requestConnection() have to
 * called by the two participants which intend to establish a connection. All
 * following communication and process ranking refers to the remote
 * communication space afterwards.
 *
 * Sending methods prefixed with `a' are asynchronous. It means that they return
 * immediately, even though either the actual sending might have not been
 * started yet or data from user buffer that is being supplied has not been
 * safely stored away (to system buffer) yet. This implies that user buffer
 * cannot be immediately reused (for writing) after asynchronous sending call
 * returns. However, a special corresponding "request" object is returned by all
 * asynchronous sending methods, which could be further used in future in order
 * to properly wait (block execution) until either the corresponding sending
 * request has truly finished or data from user buffer that is being supplied
 * has been safely stored away (to system buffer) and, thus, can be reused (for
 * writing).
 *
 * The main benefit from asynchronous sending methods is their deterministic
 * behavior, i.e. the guarantee that they can never block the execution (return
 * immediately). The two typical scenarios where this comes handy are:
 * 1. Robustness --- allows one to write deadlock-prone communication algorithms
 *    (see point-to-point communication).
 * 2. Efficiency --- allows one to perform some useful computational work while
 *    sending is happening on the background.
 *
 * @attention All receive methods, that accept a raw array, expect it to be
 * sized appropriately. Asynchronous receive methods also expect the vector
 * be sized correctly.
