/**
 * @brief Abstract base class for partitions.
 *
 * A Partition describes how a mesh is decomposed among multiple ranks and
 * is associated to a "provide-mesh" or "receive-mesh" a participant holds. This class holds the
 * structures that describe the decomposition (if not the mesh) and compute
 * them.
 *
 * A Partition can come in two flavors: Either defined by a participant
 * (provide-mesh) or received from another participant (receive-mesh).
 *
 * Access to the associated mesh, to both mappings (from and to this mesh),
 * and to an m2n communication to another participant is necessary.
