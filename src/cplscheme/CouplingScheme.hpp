/**
 * @brief Interface for all coupling schemes.
 *
 * ! General description
 * A coupling scheme computes the actions to be done by the coupled participants
 * (solvers) in time. It provides interface functions to setup, advance and
 * shutdown the coupling scheme and interface functions to query the state of
 * the coupling scheme and required actions of the participants.
 *
 * ! Usage
 * -# create an object of a concrete coupling scheme class
 *    (ExplicitCouplingScheme, e.g.)
 * -# add all meshes holding data to the coupling scheme by addMesh()
 * -# configure the object by adding subclass specific information
 * -# start the coupling scheme with initialize(), where the name of the local
 *    participant, i.e. the participant using the coupling scheme object, is
 *    needed
 * -# retrieve necessary information about sent/received data and the state of
 *    the coupled simulation
 * -# query and fulfill required actions
 * -# compute data to be sent (possibly taking into account received data from
 *    initialize())
 * -# advance the coupling scheme in 4 steps:
 *    firstSynchronization, firstExchange, secondSynchronization, secondExchange;
 * -# ....
 * -# when the method isCouplingOngoing() returns false, call finalize() to
 *    stop the coupling scheme
