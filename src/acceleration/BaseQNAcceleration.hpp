/* ****************************************************************************
 *
 * A few comments concerning the present design choice.
 *
 * All the functions from the base class BAseQNAcceleration are specialized in
 * the sub classes as needed. This is done vi overwriting the base functions in
 * the specialized sub classes and calling the respective base function after
 * performing the specialized stuff (in order to perform the common, generalized
 * computations i.e. handling of V,W matrices etc.)
 * However, for the performAcceleration Method we decided (for better readability)
 * to have this method only in the base class, while introducing a function
 * performPPSecondaryData that handles all the specialized stuff concerning acceleration
 * processing for the secondary data in the sub classes.
 *
 * Another possibility would have been to introduce a bunch of functions like
 * initializeSpecialized(), removeMatrixColumnSpecialized(),
 * iterationsConvergedSpecialized(), etc
 * and call those function from the base class top down to the sub classes.
 *
 * The third possibility was to separate the approximation of the Jacobian from
 * the common stuff like handling V,W matrices in the acceleration.
 * Here, we have a class QNAcceleration that handles the V,W stuff and the basic
 * scheme of the QN update. Furthermore we have a base class (or rather interface)
 * JacobianApproximation with sub classes IQNIMVJAPX and IQNAPX that handle all the
 * specialized stuff like Jacobian approximation, handling of secondary data etc.
 * However, this approach is not feasible, as we have to call the function
 * removeMatrixColumn() down in the specialized sub classes IQNIMVJApx and IQNApx.
 * This is not possible as the function works on the V, W matrices that are
 * completely treated by QNAcceleration.
