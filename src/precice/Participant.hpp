/** @brief forwards-compatible typedef for C++17 \ref std::string_view.
 *
 * The \ref string_view is a read-only view into sequence of characters.
 *
 * A good mental model for this type is a struct containing a pointer and a size like the following:
 *
 * @code{cpp}
 * struct string_view {
 *   const char* first;
 *   size_t size;
 * };
 * @endcode
 *
 * It can be constructed from:
 * - a pointer to a NULL-terminated C-string
 * - a pointer and a size
 * - a pointer to the first and one past the last element
 * - \ref std::string can directly convert itself to \ref std::string_view.
 *
 * In practise, using a function such as \ref Participant::getMeshDimensions() that expects a string_view looks like this:
 *
 * You can directly pass the string literal:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * getMeshDimensions("MyMesh");
 * @endcode
 *
 * Or you can pass something string-like:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * // one of
 * const char*      meshName = "MyMesh";
 * std::string      meshName = "MyMesh";
 * // followed by
 * getMeshDimensions(meshName);
 * @endcode
 *

   *
   * The API of preCICE is accessible via the \ref Participant class.
   * A constructed \ref Participant directly corresponds to a participant in the configuration file.
   *
   * Constructors require defining the parallel context of the Participant by providing
   * index and size of the current process, which are equivalent to rank and size in the MPI terminology.
   *
   * If preCICE is compiled with MPI, then there are multiple ways for it to be used:
   * 1. if a custom communicator is provided, preCICE uses it
   * 2. if MPI is already initialized, preCICE uses the MPI_COMM_WORLD
   * 3. otherwise, preCICE initializes MPI itself and uses the MPI_COMM_WORLD
   *
   * The MPI initialization is independent of which kind IntraCommunicator is configured.

   * @brief setMeshAccessRegion Define a region of interest on a received mesh
   *        (<receive-mesh ... from="otherParticipant />") in order to receive
   *        only a certain mesh region. Have a look at the website under
   *        https://precice.org/couple-your-code-direct-access.html or
   *        navigate manually to the page  Docs->Couple your code
   *        -> Advanced topics -> Accessing received meshes directly for
   *        a comprehensive documentation
   *
   * This function is required if you don't want to use the mapping
   * schemes in preCICE, but rather want to use your own solver for
   * data mapping. As opposed to the usual preCICE mapping, only a
   * single mesh (from the other participant) is now involved in this
   * situation since an 'own' mesh defined by the participant itself
   * is not required any more. In order to re-partition the received
   * mesh, the participant needs to define the mesh region it wants
   * read data from and write data to.
   * The mesh region is specified through an axis-aligned bounding
   * box given by the lower and upper [min and max] bounding-box
   * limits in each space dimension [x, y, z].
   *
   * @note Defining a bounding box for serial runs of the solver (not
   * to be confused with serial coupling mode) is valid. However, a
   * warning is raised in case vertices are filtered out completely
   * on the receiving side, since the associated data values of the
   * filtered vertices are filled with zero data.
   *
   * @note This function can only be called once per participant and
   * rank and trying to call it more than once results in an error.
   *
   * @note If you combine the direct access with a mpping (say you want
   * to read data from a defined mesh, as usual, but you want to directly
   * access and write data on a received mesh without a mapping) you may
   * not need this function at all since the region of interest is already
   * defined through the defined mesh used for data reading. This is the
   * case if you define any mapping involving the directly accessed mesh
   * on the receiving participant. (In parallel, only the cases
   * read-consistent and write-conservative are relevant, as usual).
   *
   * @note The safety factor scaling (see safety-factor in the configuration
   * file) is not applied to the defined access region and a specified safety
   * will be ignored in case there is no additional mapping involved. However,
   * in case a mapping is in addition to the direct access involved, you will
   * receive (and gain access to) vertices inside the defined access region
   * plus vertices inside the safety factor region resulting from the mapping.
   * The default value of the safety factor is 0.5,i.e., the defined access
   * region as computed through the involved provided mesh is by 50% enlarged.
