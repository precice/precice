- Added header `precice/Exceptions.hpp` which provides the preCICE exception type `precice::Error`. It is included via `precice/precice.hpp`.
- Changed the C++ API to throw a `precice::Error` instead of aborting if preCICE detects an error. This allows adapters to clean up on error and makes preCICE easier to use via interactive sessions.
- Fixed mismatched MPI communicator sizes to trigger an assertion before their sanitization check.
