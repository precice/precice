- Renamed the 'direct-access' flag in `<receive-mesh direct-access="..." />` to 'api-access' `<receive-mesh api-access="..." />` and deprecated `direct-access`.
- Fixed the API functions "setMeshAccessRegion" and "getMeshVertexIDsAndCoordinates" to now require the flag api-access="true". If not set, the function will throw an error.
- Changed the behavior of the function "getMeshVertexIDsAndCoordinates", when combining direct-mesh access with mappings, to return only the vertices within the defined access region ("setMeshAccessRegion"). Setting an access region is mandatory if no other mapping is defined. In parallel, it has been mandatory anyway.
- Added experimental support for just-in-time mapping with NN and PU-RBF via the new API functions 'mapAndReadData' and 'writeAndMapData'.
