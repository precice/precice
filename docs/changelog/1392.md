- Added a new interface file `precice/Version.h`, which provides version macros `PRECICE_VERSION_MAJOR`, `PRECICE_VERSION_MINOR`, `PRECICE_VERSION_PATCH` as well as the stringified version `PRECICE_VERSION`. Use the convenience macro `PRECICE_VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL(2,4,0)` to check for compatibility. `SolverInterface.hpp` and `SolverInterfaceC.h` now include `Version.h` to simplify macro usage on older version lacking the header.
