# preCICE Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. For future plans, see our [Roadmap](https://www.precice.org/fundamentals-roadmap.html).

## 3.0.0

- Added API method `getMaxTimeStepSize()`, replacing return values and simplifying usability of `advance(double dt)` and `initialize()`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1623)
- Added CMake presets for simpler configuration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1452)
- Added Wendland's compactly supported C2 and C4 RBF functions. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1378)
- Added `<mapping:rbf>` alias defaulting to the `rbf-pum-direct`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1616)
- Added `precicef_get_version_information_` to Fortran bindings. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1487)
- Added a `scaled-consistent-volume` mapping constraint in order to scale by volumetric primitives. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1387)
- Added a mapping configuration subtag `executor` to specify where and how RBF data mappings should be computed: `cpu` (default), `cuda`, `hip`, or `openmp`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1630)
- Added a new mixed convergence measure `absolute-or-relative-convergence-measure`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1862)
- Added a warning for empty IQN matrix, but keep the simulation going. This allows to start from a zero initial state that only later changes (e.g., an opening valve in a flow simulation) (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1895)
- Added an optional preconditioner to the Aitken underrelaxation acceleration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1379)
- Added check for duplicated `<exchange/>` tags. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1467)
- Added communication of substeps data for waveform coupling. A new attribute `substeps` in the `exchange` tag allows activating and deactivating this additional communication. `substeps` defaults to `false`, since not yet all acceleration schemes support this feature. This default may change once preCICE is fully ported to handling waveforms.  See https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/1825 for details. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1664)
- Added compactly supported Wendland C8 basis function. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1871)
- Added configuration option for participants waiting for each other in finalize: `<precice-configuration wait-in-finalize="1"/>`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1840)
- Added default values for the IQN-ILS and IQN-IMVJ configuration options `initial-relaxation`, `max-used-iterations`, `time-windows-reused`, `filter`, and `preconditioner`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1754)
- Added dependency versions to the CMake output. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1430)
- Added descriptive errors when providing incorrect mesh or data names. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1588)
- Added efficient bulk functions `setMeshEdges|Triangles|Quads|Tetrahedra` for setting connectivity based on an array of vertex IDs. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1322)
- Added error message when attempting to initialize data on a directly-accessed mesh, which is not available before initialization. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1592)
- Added error messages for inconsistent argument sizes. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1641)
- Added experimental support for building preCICE with Ginkgo. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1630)
- Added experimental, serial implementations for `axial-geometric-multiscale` and `radial-geometric-multiscale` consistent mapping types for 1D-3D geometric multiscale. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1439)
- Added gradient data to constant and Aitken underrelaxation. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1373)
- Added gradient related API functions to native Fortran and C bindings. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1374)
- Added partition of unity RBF mapping as a more efficient alternative to existing RBF mapping for large cases. The mapping can be configured using `<mapping:rbf-pum-direct ... > <basis-function:... /> </mapping:rbf-pum-direct>`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1483)
- Added preprocessing of mesh connectivity, which removes duplicates and completes hierarchical connectivity, if required. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1494)
- Added sample generation from write-data of substeps that result from subcycling, allowing higher-order B-spline interpolation. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1671)
- Added support for a single participant to use multiple coupling schemes with different time-window-sizes. This currently doesn't work with actions. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1705)
- Added support for higher-order B-spline interpolation (based on multiple samples in current window). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1422)
- Added support for implicit coupling schemes without convergence measures, which always iterate `max-iterations` times per time window. Not defining convergence measures now requires `max-iterations` to be defined. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1841)
- Added support for multiple data sets in the Aitken underrelaxation acceleration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1379)
- Added support for using constant underrelaxation with waveforms. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1794)
- Added support for waveform interpolation with multi coupling. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1445)
- Added support for waveform iterations for the serial-explicit coupling. The `second` participant can now use higher-order time interpolation. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1602)
- Added support to include preCICE as CMake subproject. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1615)
- Added tag `min-iterations` to coupling schemes, which allows defining a minimal amount of iterations before convergence measures are taken into account. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1841)
- Added tool `precice-profiling` to post-process the generated profiling files. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1419)
- Added warning if subcycling over multiple windows introduces time drift leading to very small maximum time step sizes. See #1866 for details. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1867)
- Added warnings for `scaled-consistent` mappings unable to uphold their conservation constraint. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1697)
- Added waveform interpolation also for serial coupling. A serial coupling scheme now allows interpolation for both participants. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1352)
- Allowed `initialize=true` for send and write data of both participants in serial coupling schemes (consistently with parallel coupling schemes). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1367)
- Changed data samples containing only 0 to be skipped when mapping samples during `initialize`. This prevents mapping samples when using `<exchange ... initialize="false" />`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1742)
- Changed API function `getMaxTimeStepSize()` to return `dt = 0.0` if called after `final advance(dt)` (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1906)
- Changed API function `readData(...)` such that it may only be called after `initialize()` (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1906)
- Changed API function `readData(...)` to only accept `relativeReadTime = 0.0`, if called after final `advance(dt)` (i.e. not `isCouplingOngoing()`) (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1906)
- Changed API function `writeData(...)` such that it may only be called before the final `advance(dt)` (i.e. not isCouplingOngoing()) (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1906)
- Changed API to guarantee the creation of hierarchical connectivity. For example, `setMeshTriangle` now ensures necessary edges exist internally. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1322)
- Changed API to use names instead of ids for meshes and data. Functions now accept a mesh name instead of a mesh id, and a mesh and data name instead of a data id. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1588)
- Changed C++ API from pointers to `precice::span`, which is forward-compatible with `std::span`. Every provided span contains an associated size, which is required to be correctly sized. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1641)
- Changed CMake to hide non-API symbols by default, significantly reducing binary size. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1498)
- Changed PETSc detection to rely solely on pkg-config. `PETSC_DIR` and `PETSC_ARCH` are no longer used to infer possible locations of the `PETSc.pc` file. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1547)
- Changed `waveform-degree="1"` to be default and time interpolation to non-experimental (no need to use `experimental="true"` anymore). Note on explicit schemes: Depending on the scheme for some participants `waveform-degree="1"` technically leads to a zeroth order interpolation. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1684)
- Changed argument `relativeReadTime` to be mandatory in `readData()`, use `0` to get the current point in time and `getMaxTimeStepSize()` to get the end of the time window. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1622)
- Changed data and mesh names in solverdummy configuration to match naming conventions. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1548)
- Changed default values of `rbf-pum` to 50 vertices per cluster and a relative overlap of 0.15. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1872)
- Changed direct-mesh access to be non-experimental. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1740)
- Changed error to warning when trying to add a zero-value column to `V` matrix in QN-acceleration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1863)
- Changed execution order of schemes per participant to explicit schemes in configured order, followed by one optional implicit scheme. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1462)
- Changed internal time handling to a Kahan accumulator, preventing issues combining `max-time` with a small `time-windows-size` or when subcycling. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1933 https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1934)
- Changed read mapping to be conditional during data initialization. This has a minor influence on some events being triggered and avoids performing unnecessary mappings. See #834. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1404)
- Changed storage so that it does not build the B-spline interpolant when reading from existing timestamps. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1837)
- Changed the data API to taking `precice::span`, reducing the API to `readData`, `writeData`, and `writeGradientData`. Sizes are checked at the API boundary and are required to be consistent. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1636)
- Changed the initial guess for global-iterative mappings to reset to zero after each completed time window. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1660)
- Changed the minimum supported C++ version from 14 to 17. The API only requires to be compiled with C++ 11. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1413)
- Changed the partition-of-unity mapping to only create a single cluster, if the desired number of vertices per cluster is smaller than the local number of vertices. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1736)
- Disabled the default PETSc signal handler in case preCICE needs to initialize PETSc. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1434)
- Fixed *init* export written at the end of `initialize`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1796)
- Fixed CMake to correctly require Eigen version 3.3.7. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1618)
- Fixed `nearest-projection` mapping behavior to map to the closest primitive instead of the highest-dimensional primitive available. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1351)
- Fixed `precice-tools check` not displaying errors if the logger is disabled in the checked config. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1477)
- Fixed a crash when using `precice-tools check` to check configurations that use PETSc-based RBF mappings. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1578)
- Fixed bug for increasing time window size with participant first method and waveform relaxation by adding a corresponding check to prevent wrong usage. See https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1770 for details. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1789)
- Fixed deadlock in two-level initialization, which occurs if ranks share vertices, but only one of the ranks actually needs the vertices (or any) to compute the mapping. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1847)
- Fixed missing error on mismatched closing XML tags (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1574)
- Fixed missing include path for C-bindings when using preCICE via pkg-config directly from the build directory. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1931)
- Fixed preconditioners dividing by zero in case of coupling data always being zero and not changing over time. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1910)
- Fixed remapping of a time windows initial data sample in implicit coupling schemes. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1899)
- Fixed scaled-consistent mapping constraints with an output integral of zero to dividing by zero. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1697)
- Fixed subcycling when combining an implicit coupling scheme with any other coupling scheme. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1705)
- Fixed the Fortran API to use lowercase `id` in functions setting mesh vertices. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1624)
- Fixed the faulty conflict while using `no-restart` mode for restart and `always-build-jacobian` mode at the same time in IQN-IMVJ acceleration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1856)
- Fixed the formula of the `residual-relative-convergence-measure` in the documentation. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1769)
- Fixed the threshold value for truncation in SVD for IQN-IMVJ using SVD-restart. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1815)
- Improved error messages of unknown tags and attributes in the configuration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1573)
- Improved parallel single-level initialization significantly by optimizing communication map creation. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1830)
- Improved the computation of the owner rank for shared vertices between ranks in parallel computations, leading to a significant speed-up of the two-level initialization. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1849)
- Improved the runtime of `readData` by implementing a cache for the computations in the BSpline interpolation. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1765)
- Moved `precice::getVersionInformation()` to `precice/Tooling.hpp`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1473)
- Moved the configuration attribute `dimensions` from the `solver-interface` XML tag to the `mesh` tag. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1742)
- Moved the configuration to enable synchronization from the root tag to profiling: `<profiling synchronize="true" />`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1743)
- Removed *final* export written in `finalize`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1796)
- Removed API function `initializeData()`, as data initialization is now performed in `initialize()`. Initial data has to be written before `initialize()`, directly after defining the mesh. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1350)
- Removed API functions `hasMesh` and `hasData`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1741)
- Removed API functions `isReadDataAvailable()` and is `isWriteDataRequired()` as waveforms eliminate their use-cases. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1362)
- Removed Broyden acceleration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1735)
- Removed `ComputeCurvatureAction` action. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1614)
- Removed `getMeshID()`, `getDataID()`, and `getDataIDs()` as we directly use names now. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1588)
- Removed `getMeshVertexIDsFromPositions` and `getMeshVertices`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1556)

- Removed `precice::constants` from the C++ API and the C and Fortran bindings. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1487)
- Removed `valid-digits` from `<time-window-size ... />`. preCICE now always uses the internal numerical precision for checking if the end of the time window has been reached. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1882)
- Removed action `ScaleByDtAction`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1403)
- Removed action timings `read-mapping-prior`, `write-mapping-prior`, and `on-time-window-complete-post`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1614)
- Removed callback functions `vertexCallback` and `postAction` from `PythonAction` interface. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1614)
- Removed dead-axis option from rbf-pum mappings. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1872)
- Removed deprecated API function `precicef_ongoing_()` in fortran bindings. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1537)
- Removed deprecated API functions `mapWriteDataFrom()` and `mapReadDataTo()` (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1222)
- Removed deprecated XML attributes related to normals: `<mesh flip-normals="0">` and `<export:vtk normals="1"/>`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1475)
- Removed deprecated XML tags using terminology master and slave. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1474)
- Removed deprecated action timings `regular-prior`, `regular-post`, `on-exchange-prior`, and `on-exchange-post`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1614)
- Removed deprecated aliases `<intra-comm:mpi-single />` and `<m2n:mpi-singleports />`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1781)
- Removed deprecated mapping timings, as there is no use-case anymore. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1536)
- Removed edge IDs from the API: `setMeshEdge` now returns nothing, all `setMeshXWithEdges` variants were removed from the API, and `setMeshTriangle|Quad` now accepts vertex IDs instead of edge IDs. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1322)
- Removed extrapolation feature from coupling schemes. Initial guess for acceleration is now always constant extrapolation (i.e. use converged results from end of last time window). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1738)
- Removed internally shipped dependency `nlohmann/json`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1759)
- Removed second order extrapolation in acceleration scheme due to unclear use-case at high maintenance cost. Please contact us if you have a use-case that requires this feature. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1503)
- Removed support for multiple implicit coupling-schemes per participant. Use `<coupling-scheme:multi>` instead. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1462)
- Removed symbolic link `binprecice`. The executable is now called `precice-tools`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1595)
- Removed the API stubs for `hasToEvaluateSurrogateModel()` and `hasToEvaluateFineModel()`, which were part of the deprecated Manifold mapping. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1472)
- Removed the XML configuration tag `<solver-interface>` and moved all attributes to the parent `<precice-configuration>` tag. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1662)
- Removed the `preallocation` option in the `rbf-global-iterative` mapping configuration. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1758)
- Removed the ability to install tests via `PRECICE_InstallTest`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1499)
- Removed the deprecated `vtk` exporter fallback for parallel participants. If a parallel participant will try to use the `vtk` exporter, it will cause an error and ask the user to change the exporter to a compatible one (like vtu). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1784)
- Removed trailing space in watchpoint, convergence, and iteration log files. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1620)
- Renamed CMake variables consistently. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1744)
- Renamed `<mapping:rbf... use-qr-decomposition="true" />` to `<mapping:rbf-global-direct ... > <basis-function:... /> </mapping:rbf-global-direct>` (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1550)
- Renamed `SolverInterface` to `Participant` in the API. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1643)
- Renamed `isGradientDataRequired()` to `requiresGradientDataFor()` (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1487)
- Renamed `isMeshConnectivityRequired()` to `requiresMeshConnectivityFor()` (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1487)
- Renamed `waveform-order` to `waveform-degree` and moved this attribute from `read-data` to `<data:scalar ... />`, respectively `<data:vector ... />`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1714)
- Renamed precice-events to precice-profiling in configuration, tests, and scripts (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1787)
- Renamed the `<m2n:... />` attributes `from` and `to` to `acceptor` and `connector`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1683)
- Renamed the `scaled-consistent` mapping constraint to `scaled-consistent-surface`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1387)
- Renamed the direct-mesh API function `getMeshVerticesAndIDs` to `getMeshVertexIDsAndCoordinates`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1740)
- Renamed the primary API header files `SolverInterface.hpp` to `precice.hpp`, `SolverInterfaceC.h` to `preciceC.h`, and `SolverInterfaceFortran.hpp` to `preciceFortran.hpp`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1654)
- Replaced `getDimensions()` with `getMeshDimensions(meshName)` and `getDataDimensions(meshName, dataName)`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1631)
- Replaced `isActionRequired()` and `markActionFulfilled()` with explicit calls `requiresInitialData()`, `requiresReadingCheckpoint()`, and `requiresWritingCheckpoint()`. Invoking these functions is a promise to preCICE that the caller fulfills the requirement. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1487)
- Replaced all `<mapping:rbf... />` related tags. RBF mappings are now defined in terms of the applied solver (`<mapping:rbf-global-direct ...` or `<mapping:rbf-global-iterative`) and the applied basis function is a subtag of the solver. Users should use the additionally added auto selection of an appropriate solver as follows: `<mapping:rbf  ...> <basis-function:... /> </mapping:rbf>`. Example: `<mapping:compact-polynomial-c0 direction="read" from= ... support-radius="0.3" />` would become `<mapping:rbf  direction="read" from= ...> <basis-function:compact-polynomial-c0 support-radius="0.3" /> </mapping:rbf>` (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1550)
- Replaced tag `<use-mesh />` with dedicated tags for `<receive-mesh />` and `<provide-mesh />`. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1450)
- Replaced the Eigen-based QR decomposition by a Cholesky decomposition for s.p.d. data mapping matrices, resulting in a signifacant speed-up (affecting Gaussian RBF, compact polynomial RBFs and inverse multiquadrics). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1372)
- Replaced the internal profiling tool to improve error-robustness and reduce complexity. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1419)
- Updated fmt to version 10.2.1 (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1928)

## 2.5.1

- Changed error to warning in case of an empty IQN matrix, keeping the simulation going. This allows to start from a zero initial state that only later changes (e.g., an opening valve in a flow simulation). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1895)
- Changed error to warning when trying to add a zero-value column to `V` matrix in QN-acceleration (Backport of https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1863)
- Fixed compatibility with libxml version 2.12.0. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1886)

- Added C and Fortran bindings for setMeshTetrahedron (`precicec_setMeshTetrahedron` and `precicef_set_tetrahedron`). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1382)
- Added a clang-tidy CI and enforced the updated clang-tidy format. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/999)
- Added a new interface file `precice/Version.h`, which provides version macros `PRECICE_VERSION_MAJOR`, `PRECICE_VERSION_MINOR`, `PRECICE_VERSION_PATCH` as well as the stringified version `PRECICE_VERSION`. Use the convenience macro `PRECICE_VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL(2,4,0)` to check for compatibility. `SolverInterface.hpp` and `SolverInterfaceC.h` now include `Version.h` to simplify macro usage on older version lacking the header. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1392)
- Added checks during the establishment of inter-participant communication in order to safeguard against common issues. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1290)
- Added checks of MPI ports functions and descriptive error messages. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1292)
- Added default network interface for BSD-flavored operating systems. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1332)
- Added pre-commit configuration, which drastically simplifies contributing. Required formatting tools will now be installed by pre-commit. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1359)
- Added support for "Linear Cell Interpolation" data mapping in 2D. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1297)
- Added success statement to `precice-tools check valid-config.xml`, which used to output nothing. ((https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1406)
- Added support for polynomial="separate" and polynomial="off" for Eigen based RBF mappings (use-qr-decomposition="true"). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1335)

- Added support in VTK and VTU exporters for exporting tetrahedral elements. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1314)
- Added support to export gradient data in VTK exporting. Scalar gradients are written to a vector `<ScalarDataname>_gradient` (`v0_dx,v0_dy,v0_dz,v1_dx ...`), vector gradients are written to multiple vectors `<VectorDataname>_dx/dy/dz` (`v0x_dx,v0y_dx,v0z_dz, ...`). (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1315)
- Added support to export gradient data in XML based exporting, VTU, VTP. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1340)
- Added tetrahedron communication. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1325)
- Added the `PRECICE_BUILD_TOOLS` (ON by default) CMake variable in order to enable/disable the generation of the `precice-tools` executable. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1344)
- Changed behavior of "Watchpoints" to look for cell interpolation instead of boundary interpolation, if possible. (https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/1361)

## 1.6.1

- Fixed a platform-dependent issue with boost.

## 1.6.0

- Added CMake target to uninstall the project.
- Added `INFO` log output of the connection build-up during the instantiation. This dramatically simplifies the identification of connection-related problems.
- Added `precice::getVersionInformation()` to the interface. This returns a semicolon separated list of information containing the version, configuration, compiler and flags used to compile the library.
- Added additional checks for wrong user input in SolverInterface.
- Added basic index validation of user input to the SolverInterface
- Added events for mapping internals such as the computation of the mapping and the index-generation.
- Added more "pythonic" python bindings `precice_future`. More: [here](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/379) and [here](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues/458)
- Added overrides for dependencies, allowing users to force CMake to use a given version. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Building:-Using-CMake#xsdk-compliance)
- Added support for the `CPP` and `CPPFLAGS` environment variables. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Building:-Using-CMake#xsdk-compliance)
- Added support for the xsdk default mode. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/wiki/Building:-Using-CMake#xsdk-compliance)
- Added the CMake variable `PRECICE_CTEST_MPI_FLAGS` which can be used to pass additional flags to `mpirun`. A common use-case is to enable oversubscribing on machines with only 2 cores by passing `--oversubscribe`.
- Added the possibility to pass a custom `MPI_Comm` to preCICE via a new SolverInterface constructor. The passed communicator is then used as the global internal communicator. The user has to ensure that the mpi implementations of preCICE and the caller code are consistent and compatible.
- Added the result of `git describe --tags --dirty` to the library, which is now displayed during the configuration of preCICE. This allows quickly check what commit you are actually using and whether there were local changes.
- Added tests for python bindings using a mocked preCICE C++ Interface. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/420)
- Added validation of dependencies in the CMake script.
- Changed the connection publishing to a hash-based approach. This method is faster, more robust and NFS-friendly. The files are rooted in the folder `precice-run`, deleting this folder resolves most connection problems.
- Changed the errors in the configuration stage to throw `std::runtime_error`.
- Changed the id management from `std::set` to `boost::container::flat_set`. This reduces the peak memory consumption of meshes by about 9%.
- Changed the log output for filtered vertices. Log level `INFO` prints the total number of filtered vertices. The detailed information was moved to `DEBUG`.
- Changed the scope of the generated `version.[ch]pp` files to `precice/impl`. This prevents collisions with other random version headers.
- Changed and optimized the index generation for an individual speed up of 10-20x.
- Changed and optimized some complexity issues in the generation of communication maps for an individual speedup of around 1000x for bigger meshes.
- Changed and optimized some complexity issues in `NearestNeighbour::tagFirstRound` leading to an individual speedup of around 100x.
- Deprecated the python bindings `precice`, which will be removed in preCICE Version 2.0.0. If you still want to use them, please install `precice` and `precice_future`. Our recommendation, if you want to use the new bindings: Use `import precice_future as precice`.
- Fixed a bug in the python bindings which ignored the memory layout of numpy array. We now use `numpy.ascontiguousarray` to guarantee a C-compatible layout of data structures. [Read more](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/448)
- Fixed a major memory issue due to excessive logger instantiations. This reduced peak memory consumption and allocation count of meshes by 50%.
- Fixed compatibility with Eigen versions `>3.3.7`.
- Fixed macro namespace by using the `PRECICE_` prefix. This prevents collisions with foreign macros.
- Fixed the index-based version of the nearest projection mapping and reintegrated it.
- Fixed wrong user input in Triangle creation to trigger assertions instead of a comprehensive user error.
- Fixed a bug in MPI initialization when using PETRBF mappings.
- Fixed a warning message in `ReceivedPartition` displaying a wrong vertex count.

## 1.5.2

- Fixed faulty communication in `master:sockets` leading to crashes.

## 1.5.1

- Fixed the exposure of `boost::asio` implementation details leading to version incompatibilities
- Fixed the CMake linkage of Boost to become compatible with the generated CMake config of Boost 1.70.0

## 1.5.0

- Added CMake alias `precice::precice` which mimics the namespaced library name after calling `find_package(precice)`. This allows seamless use as a subproject.
- Added state-awareness to the SolverInterface to keep track of the Mesh states. This results more informative error messages for mesh related functions.
- Added faster `PetRadialBasisFctMapping` tagging using RTree queries.
- Added potentially missing signal `SIGXCPU`.
- Added sanitization of IDs to the SolverInterface and harden it against misconfiguration using a consistent mechanism to express requirements.
- Added support for using preCICE directly from the binary tree using `precice_DIR` in other projects.
- Added target `test_install`, which can be used to test the install. It configures builds and runs the cpp solverdummy using the installed preCICE library.
- Added the ability to send a mesh to multiple participants.
- Added the attribute `Participant` to the logger, which is now available in format and filter expressions.
- Added the automatic creation of target directories, when exporting meshes with `<export:vtk ...>`.
- Added the data name to the log output of convergence measures.
- Added the generation of a pkg-config file for preCICE, which is usable after installing.
- Added the generation of code coverage reports.
- Changed the tested build-system in CI from SCons to CMake.
- Fixed a **critical bug** in the nearest projection mapping rooting in the variant index tree. We decided to roll-back to the old implementation until there is a fix.
- Fixed PETSc complaining about unused arguments when running tests.
- Fixed `bindings/fortran` to use `precice::SolverInterface` instead of `precice::impl::SolverInterfaceImpl`
- Fixed a potential integer overflow when parsing huge numbers in the configuration code.
- Fixed a potential overflow in the computation of the side length of bounding boxes.
- Fixed bug in preconditioner when we have convergence in the first iteration.
- Fixed integration tests resetting the log-level by calling `configure`.
- Fixed missing includes for Eigen
- Fixed overuse of `std::endl` in code, file generation should be noticeably faster now.
- Fixed the `const`ness of passed pointer arguments as well as some member functions of the `SolverInterface`.
- Fixed the default safety factor for nearest projection mapping by increasing it from 0.1 to 0.5.
- Fixed Python bindings now offer all preCICE API functions (except `get_mesh_handle`)
- Fixed CMake now properly detects PETSc on systems with a directory-scoped MPI installation (`include/openmpi/mpi.h`) when the compiler was not set to the MPI compiler wrapper.
- Refactored `Mesh::computeState` into two logical units, improving the trace information.
- Refactored `computePartitions` using the stl.
- Refactored logger which dramatically reduces compile times.
- Refactored the M2N handling code, which improves the available trace information for issues related to the M2N initialization.
- Removed [`#395`](https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/395) API functions `nameConfiguration(), dataDisplacements(), dataForces(), dataVelocities(), actionPlotOutput(), exportVTK(), exportAll()` from CPP API and all language bindings.
- Removed ancient `PRECIE_NO_SOCKETS` definition.
- Removed dead configuration code.
- Sending data between participants is now fully asynchronous. This is relevant in one-way coupling scenarios, where the sending participant doesn't need to wait for the receiving one.

## 1.4.1

- Bug in re-partitioning fixed, occurred for OpenFOAM and empty ranks in parallel.

## 1.4.0
- The python modules are now proper packages tracking dependencies etc.
- Fix CMake now importable from binary directory.
- The Python module for the preCICE bindings `PySolverInterface` is renamed to `precice`. This change does not break old code. Please refer to [`src/precice/bindings/python/README.md`](src/precice/bindings/python/README.md) for more information.
- Add a pkg-config for preCICE (`libprecice.pc`).
- Use the Boost stacktrace library for cross-platform stacktrace printing. **This requires Boost 1.65.1**.
- Added explicit linking to `libdl` for `boost::stacktrace`.
- Reimplemented the internals of the nearest-projection mapping to significantly reduce its initialization time.
- The EventTimings now do a time normalization among all ranks, i.e., the first event is considered to happen at t=0, all other events are adapted thereto.
- The old CSV format of the EventTimings log files, split among two files was replaced by a single file, in structured JSON format.
- Fixed memory leaks in the `xml::XMLAttributes` and `xml::Validator*`.
- Removed the `xml::Validator*` classes and replaced them in `xml::XMLAttribute` with a set of "options".
- Made `xml::XMLAttribute` and `xml::XMLTag` chainable.
- Added manpages for binprecice and testprecice.
- Fixed memory leaks in `mesh::Mesh`.
- Fixed mapping classes not flushing the underlying caches on `clear()`.
- Fixed format of version logging (first preCICE log message).
- Added tolerance of iterations in quasi-Newton tests.
- CMake overhaul:
  - Converted to target-based system: precice, testprecice, binprecice
  - New options:
    - `PRECICE_Packages` (default ON) to configure CPack,
    - `PRECICE_InstallTest` (default ON) to configure installation of tests.  
      This includes the binary `testprecice` and necessary files.
      Use `PREFIX/share/precice` as `PRECICE_ROOT`.
  - Moved CMake files from `tools/cmake-modules` to `cmake/` (general scripts) and `cmake/modules` (find modules).
  - Migrated from file-globing to explicit source/interface/test-file lists.  
    Use `tools/updateSourceFiles.py` from project-root to update all necessary files.
  - `install` target installs:
     - the library `PREFIX/lib`.
     - the binaries `PREFIX/bin` and their manfiles into `PREFIX/share/man/man1`.
     - the CMake configuration files into `PREFIX/lib/cmake/precice`.
     - the pkg-config configuration files into `PREFIX/lib/pkgconfig`
     - the necessary files to run testprecice into `PREFIX/share/precice`. Use this as `PRECICE_ROOT` on installed system.
  - CTest definition of tests run in isolated working directories:
    - `precice.Base` for the base test suite
    - `precice.MPI2` run on 2 MPI ranks
    - `precice.MPI4` run on 4 MPI ranks
  - CPack configuration of target `package` to generate binary debian, tar and zip packages.
  - Added `CMakeLists.txt` to `tools/solverdummy/cpp`. It is an example of how to link to preCICE with CMake.
  - Extended the displayed information when configuring.
- Extended `updateSourceFiles.py` to verify the sources using `git ls-files --full-name` if available.
- Fixed the `io::VTKXMLExporter` not to write VertexNormals.
- Improved the user-friendliness of the tests.
  - `make test` will run all tests.
  - `make test_base` only a unproblematic base-set.
  - A timeout will kill hanging tests.
  - All tests sets run in isolated working directories.
- Added an (experimental) Fortran 2003 solver dummy.

## 1.3.0
- Update of build procedure for python bindings (see [`precice/src/bindings/python/README.md`](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/src/precice/bindings/python/README.md) for instructions). Note: you do not have to add `PySolverInterface.so` to `PYTHONPATH` manually anymore, if you want to use it in your adapter. Python should be able to find it automatically.
- Make naming of log files consistent, following the pattern `precice-SOLVERNAME-logtype.log`, example: `precice-FLUID-eventTimings.log`
- Enable boost.geometry based preallocation. Speeds up initialization of PetRBF based mapping.
- Actions can now specify a `MeshRequirement`, such as the `ScaleByAreaAction`.
- Many events have been reworked and are now uniformly named.
- There is a `syncMode` for events (for detailed performance measurements), configurable and off by default.

## 1.2.0
- Make `polynomial=separate` the default setting for PetRBF.
- Removed ExportVRML functionality
- Build system:
  - Make `python=off` default.
- Building with Conda:
  - The helper scripts are now placed in the directory `tools/conda_building`. All the terms referring to `Anaconda` have been changed to `Conda`.
- Sending data exchange is now fully asynchronous, so that the sending participant never waits for the receiving one.
- Rename `src/precice/adapters` to `src/precice/bindings`
- adding `libprefix` option in scons build process to allow for non-standard library paths

## 1.1.1
