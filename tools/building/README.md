# Tools for assisting with building preCICE

This directory contains optional tools that are useful for developers
building preCICE often.

- `compileAndTest.py`: Build and test preCICE automatically.
  Useful, for example, for identifying the source of a regression (using `git bisect run ./compileAndTest.py`)
- `updateSourceFiles.py`: Update the list of source files that CMake needs to build.
  Useful when adding/removing source files.
- `createChangelog`: Creates a changelog file for the current PR. This is based on the GitHub CLI.
- `createTest.py`: Automatically creates integration tests
- `checkSymbols`: Takes the preCICE library and uses `readelf` to check if all cpp functions have a counterpart in C and Fortran
