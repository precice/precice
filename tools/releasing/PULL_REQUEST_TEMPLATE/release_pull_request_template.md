## How to work with this template

* [ ] assign a release manager, who takes care of the process
* [ ] assign each point below to a responsible person, before you continue. Use `@member`.

Only the release manager should update this post (even tickboxes, due to race conditions in editing). Everybody else should comment on the PR with the progress.


## Pre-PR steps

* [ ] Look over [PRs](https://github.com/precice/precice/pulls?q=is%3Apr+no%3Amilestone+is%3Aclosed) and [Issues](https://github.com/precice/precice/issues?q=is%3Aissue+no%3Amilestone+is%3Aclosed) without an assigned version. (all)
* [ ] Look over entries in [`docs/changelog`](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/docs/changelog)) (all)
   * Add missing entries, if necessary
   * Fix wording and tense
* [ ] Make sure you have the latest `develop` and `main` branches locally.
* [ ] Merge `main` to `develop` ( This should result in no commits )
* [ ] Check code base w.r.t code formatting (run [`precice/tools/formatting/check-format`](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/tools/formatting/check-format)) and reformat if required (run [`precice/tools/formatting/format-all`](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/tools/formatting/format-all))
* [ ] Update the list of operating systems for the package generation in `.github/workflows/release.yml`
* [ ] Create branch `release-vX.Y.Z` from develop. If needed, `git rebase develop`.
* [ ] Run `tools/releasing/bumpversion.sh MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` to bump the version
* [ ] Look over the updated `CHANGELOG.md` of the release branch (all)
   * Check for merged lines
   * Add things, if necessary
   * Fix wording and tense
   * Sort the entries lexicographically
   * Extract summary
* [ ] Verify the version changes in:
   * [ ] `CHANGELOG`
   * [ ] `CMakeLists.txt`
   * [ ] `tools/releasing/packaging/debian/changelog`
* [ ] Commit the version bump
* [ ] Push the release branch to the precice repository
* Prepare independent releases
   * [ ] [Python bindings](https://github.com/precice/python-bindings/blob/develop/docs/ReleaseGuide.md)
   * [ ] (if necessary!) [MATLAB bindings](https://github.com/precice/matlab-bindings/blob/develop/docs/ReleaseGuide.md)
   * [ ] (if necessary!) [JULIA bindings](https://github.com/precice/PreCICE.jl)

## Step by step guide

* [ ] Open PR from `release-vX.Y.Z` to `main` (use [this template](https://github.com/precice/precice/blob/develop/tools/releasing/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/release_pull_request_template.md))
* [ ] Do regression tests using the release branch (specific revision) _list below :arrow_down:_ (all)
* [ ] Fix potential problems in develop (all)
* [ ] Rebase the release branch on develop (all)
* [ ] Commit the version bump
* [ ] Draft message to mailing list
* [ ] Write a draft "blog post" on [Discourse](https://precice.discourse.group/)
* [ ] Update documentation (all)
   * [ ] Update [XML configuration reference](https://github.com/precice/precice.github.io/blob/master/_includes/xmlreference.md)
   * [ ] Update version in [precice/precice.github.io](https://github.com/precice/precice.github.io):
      * `_config.yml`
      * `_data/sidebars/docs_sidebar.yml`
* [ ] Approve the PR with at least two reviews (all)
* [ ] Merge PR to `main` ( use `git merge --no-ff release-vX.Y.Z` )
* [ ] Tag release on `main` `vX.Y.Z` and verify by running `git describe --tags`
* [ ] Merge back to `develop` and verify by running `git describe --tags`
* [ ] Triple check that you haven't messed anything up. (You can always discard local changes)
* [ ] Push `main` and push the `vX.Y.Z` tag
* [ ] Push `develop`
* [ ] Wait for the release pipeline
  * [ ] [To create a new draft release on GitHub](https://github.com/precice/precice/releases)
  * [ ] To automatically generate packages for the latest Debian and the two latest Ubuntu LTS versions.
* [ ] Write release text
* [ ] Publish the GitHub release


## Regression Tests

Use the following branches:
* precice `release-vX.Y.Z`
* pyprecice `python-bindings-vX.Y.Z.1`
* matlab-bindings `matlab-bindings-vX.Y.Z.1`
* rest `main`(`master`)

Run all these tests manually on your system. If you succeed, please write a comment with the revisions of the components that you used below. Example: https://github.com/precice/precice/pull/507#issuecomment-530432289 and update the table.
