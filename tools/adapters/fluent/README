1. How to build the Fluent-preCICE adapter: 
* Go to tools/adapters/fluent
* Create a subdirectory lnamd64/2ddp/ for serial execution
    and for parallel execution add a /2ddp_host/ and /2ddp_node/.
* Put the libraries of preCICE and python2.7 (libpython2.7.so) into the lnamd64 folder.
* Adapt src/makefile line 14 "SOURCES=...": There are several main udf files
    - fsi_udf.c: For FSI simulations. Needs fsi.c.
    - wave_profile_udf.c: For wave simulations with inflow profile. Needs 
      wave_profile.c.
    - wave_maker_udf.c: For wave simulations with moving wall. Needs 
      wave_maker.c.
    - fsi_and_wave_profile_udf.c: For FSI + wave simulations. Needs fsi.c and 
      wave_profile.c.
    The variable SOURCES needs one one main udf file and the correspoding .c files.
* Type: make "FLUENT_ARCH=lnamd64" to start the build. Add a "clean" to clean it.

2. How to start Fluent
- start the binary from your simulation folder
- set double precision, processing options (serial or parallel) and the dimension
(for parallel select also "show more", "parallel settings", "mpi types" -> open mpi


3. Preparing a Fluent .cas file for UDF function usage:

- Copy the lnamd64 udf lib folder to the simulation folder into /libudf/
- Start Fluent and open the .msh or .cas file to be used
- In Fluent, go to top menu Define->User Defined->Functions...->Manage... and 
  load the libudf folder. The names of the udf functions should appear in the 
  Fluent command line window. (only necessary  if not yet included in the .cas file)
- Define a function hook at Initialization. (see udf manueal, define -> user defined -> function hooks)
- Define 1 user defined memory for the faces. (define -> user defined -> memory -> 1; adds one additional double to each face for precice face ids)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Preparing a Fluent .cas file for FSI simulations

- Perform the steps in 1.,2. and 3.
- Set a user defined mesh motion according to function "gridmotions".

5. Preparing a Fluent .cas file for Wave simulations

Go through the menus on the left and perform the following steps:
- General: Set transient simulation and gravity in y-direction = -9.81
- Models: Set Multiphase VOF explicit with Implicit body force formulation activated
- Materials: Air and water-liquid (from Fluent Database) are needed
- Phases: Name phases "phase-1-air" and set air as material, as well as 
  "phase-2-water" with water as material
- Cell Zone Conditions: Activate in operating conditions "Specified operating 
  density" and keep default value.
- Boundary Conditions:
  + Set the top boundary to pressure outflow
  + Set the left boundary to velocity inlet and set for Phase mixture the 
    x- and y- velocity components to follow the corresponding UDFs, for 
    Phase-2-water set the volume fraction UDF
- Dynamic Mesh: 
  + Set the structure boundary to follow the UDF
  + Set the domain to be deforming/remeshing as needed
- Reference values: Only needed for writing output (since Fluent usese 
  dimensionless values)
- Solution methods: 
  + Set the PISO (pressure implicit) scheme and as volume fraction scheme the 
    Modified HRIC scheme

Preparing the preCICE XML configuration:
- The number of valid digits for the timestep length needs to be 8, since fluent
  has only a single precision timestep length. Set this in the tag <timestep-length ... valid-digits="8"/>
