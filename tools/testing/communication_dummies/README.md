# Communication dummies

These dummies test the m2n communication, both initialization and execution.

This example is described in the master thesis of Alexander Shukaev [1].
A smaller example is also implemented as a unit test in `src/m2n/tests`.
However, these dummies are necessary, as in the integration tests we can only
cover simple cases.
